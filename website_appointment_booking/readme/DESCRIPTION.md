This module adds public appointment booking pages to the website, powered by
the OCA `resource_booking` module.

Booking types can be published on the website with a customizable URL slug.
Visitors can browse available time slots on a monthly calendar and book an
appointment without logging in.

Key features:

- Public booking page at `/book/<slug>` for each published booking type,
  listed in the website sitemap
- Monthly calendar showing available time slots based on resource availability
- Slots displayed in the visitor's timezone, with a selector to switch
- Server-rendered slot data: no extra AJAX calls needed
- Automatic partner creation or reuse based on visitor email
- Calendar invitation sent to both parties upon confirmation, organized by
  the assigned resource
- Submitted times are validated server-side against the offered slots
- Honeypot and optional reCAPTCHA v3 protection on the public form
- Race condition handling when two visitors try to book the same slot

The out-of-hours request flow (lead creation for visitors whose working
hours do not overlap the published calendar) lives in
`website_appointment_booking_crm`.

A narrated [demo video](static/description/demo.mp4) ships with the module:
publishing a type, booking as a visitor, the out-of-hours request of the CRM
extension, and the results in the back office.
